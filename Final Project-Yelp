Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset 

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000

Example Code (Attribute is the tablename )
Select Count(*) As TotalRecords
From attribute;


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000 (id is the primary key)
ii. Hours = 1562 (business_id is the foreign key)
iii. Category = 2643 (business_id is the foreign key)
iv. Attribute = 1115 (business_id is the foreign key)
v. Review = 10000 (id is the primary key), 8090(business_id is the foreign key), 9581 (user_id is the foreign key)
vi. Checkin = 493 (business_id is the foreign key)
vii. Photo = 10000 (id is the primary key), 6493 (business_id is the foreign key)
viii. Tip = 3979 (business_id is the foreign key), 537 (user_id is the foreign key)
ix. User = 10000 (id is the primary key)
x. Friend = 11 (user_id is the foreign key)
xi. Elite_years = 2780 (user_id is the foreign key)

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	

Example Code
Select Count(distinct id)
From business;



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: No
	
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM User
WHERE id IS NULL
OR name IS NULL
OR review_count IS NULL
OR yelping_since IS NULL
OR useful IS NULL

4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min:	1	max:	5	avg: 3.7082
		
	
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars
	
		min:	1	max:	5	avg: 3.6549 
		
	
	iii. Table: Tip, Column: Likes
	
		min:	0	max:	2	avg: 0.0144
		
	
	iv. Table: Checkin, Column: Count
	
		min:	1	max:	53	avg: 1.9414
		
	
	v. Table: User, Column: Review_count
	
		min:	0	max:	2000	avg: 24.2995


Example Code
Select MIN(stars),MAX(stars),AVG(stars)
From review;
		


5. List the cities with the most reviews in descending order:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	Select city, sum(review_count) as TotalReviews

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
SELECT name,review_count AS TotalReviews
FROM user
Order by TotalReviews DESC
LIMIT 3;
	
		
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
+--------+--------------+
| name   | TotalReviews |
+--------+--------------+
| Gerald |         2000 |
| Sara   |         1629 |
| Yuri   |         1339 |
+--------+--------------+
		


8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
SELECT name,review_count AS TotalReviews,fans
FROM user
Order by fans DESC;

+-----------+--------------+------+
| name      | TotalReviews | fans |
+-----------+--------------+------+
| Amy       |          609 |  503 |
| Mimi      |          968 |  497 |
| Harald    |         1153 |  311 |
| Gerald    |         2000 |  253 |
| Christine |          930 |  173 |
| Lisa      |          813 |  159 |
| Cat       |          377 |  133 |
| William   |         1215 |  126 |
| Fran      |          862 |  124 |
| Lissa     |          834 |  120 |
| Mark      |          861 |  115 |
| Tiffany   |          408 |  111 |
| bernice   |          255 |  105 |
| Roanna    |         1039 |  104 |
| Angela    |          694 |  101 |
| .Hon      |         1246 |  101 |
| Ben       |          307 |   96 |
| Linda     |          584 |   89 |
| Christina |          842 |   85 |
| Jessica   |          220 |   84 |
| Greg      |          408 |   81 |
| Nieves    |          178 |   80 |
| Sui       |          754 |   78 |
| Yuri      |         1339 |   76 |
| Nicole    |          161 |   73 |
+-----------+--------------+------+
(Output limit exceeded, 25 of 10000 total rows shown)

The above result gives us an explanation that more reviews does not mean more fans. Gerald has 2000 total reviews but he has only 253 fans whereas Amy has 609 reviews but she has the highest number of fans. Hence Review count and fan count are not correlated. The quality of reviews increase the number of fans and not the quantity of reviews.
	

	
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer: Reviews have the word love more than hate

	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
SELECT Count(*)
From review
Where text LIKE '%love%';
+----------+
| Count(*) |
+----------+
|     1780 |
+----------+

SELECT Count(*)
From review
Where text LIKE '%hate%';
+----------+
| Count(*) |
+----------+
|      232 |
+----------+

	
	
10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
SELECT name,fans
FROM user
Order by fans DESC
LIMIT 10;
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
+-----------+------+
| name      | fans |
+-----------+------+
| Amy       |  503 |
| Mimi      |  497 |
| Harald    |  311 |
| Gerald    |  253 |
| Christine |  173 |
| Lisa      |  159 |
| Cat       |  133 |
| William   |  126 |
| Fran      |  124 |
| Lissa     |  120 |
+-----------+------+

	
	
11. Is there a strong relationship (or correlation) between having a high number of fans and being listed as "useful" or "funny?" Out of the top 10 users with the highest number of fans, what percent are also listed as “useful” or “funny”?

Key:
0% - 25% - Low relationship
26% - 75% - Medium relationship
76% - 100% - Strong relationship
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
SELECT name,fans,useful,funny
FROM user
ORDER BY fans DESC
LIMIT 10;
	
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
+-----------+------+--------+--------+
| name      | fans | useful |  funny |
+-----------+------+--------+--------+
| Amy       |  503 |   3226 |   2554 |
| Mimi      |  497 |    257 |    138 |
| Harald    |  311 | 122921 | 122419 |
| Gerald    |  253 |  17524 |   2324 |
| Christine |  173 |   4834 |   6646 |
| Lisa      |  159 |     48 |     13 |
| Cat       |  133 |   1062 |    672 |
| William   |  126 |   9363 |   9361 |
| Fran      |  124 |   9851 |   7606 |
| Lissa     |  120 |    455 |    150 |
+-----------+------+--------+--------+
	
	
	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	Amy has the most fans but that does not mean she is listed userful or funny the most.Harald has 311 fans but is listed as the most useful and funny. So there is no strong relationship between having a high number of fans and being listed as userful or funny. There are other factors like review count, date since they started yelp etc. that matters.
	
	
	

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
Category: Shopping City:Las Vegas
As you can see this is not a great sample size to come to a conclusion. The shopping centers have same starting hours however the 4-5 star stores close a earlier compared to the 2-3 star stores. 
+--------------------------------+-----------+----------+-------+---------------------+--------------+------------------------+-------------+
| name                           | city      | category | stars | hours               | review_count | address                | postal_code |
+--------------------------------+-----------+----------+-------+---------------------+--------------+------------------------+-------------+
| Walgreens                      | Las Vegas | Shopping |   2.5 | Saturday|8:00-22:00 |            6 | 3808 E Tropicana Ave   | 89121       |
| Red Rock Canyon Visitor Center | Las Vegas | Shopping |   4.5 | Saturday|8:00-16:30 |           32 | 1000 Scenic Loop Dr    | 89161       |
| Desert Medical Equipment       | Las Vegas | Shopping |   5.0 | Monday|8:00-17:00   |            4 | 3555 W Reno Ave, Ste F | 89118       |
+--------------------------------+-----------+----------+-------+---------------------+--------------+------------------------+-------------+

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
    Yes, 2-3 star shopping centers have 6 reviews when compared to 4-5 star shopping centers having 36. Thus 4-5 star shopping centers have more reviews when compared to 2-3 star shopping centers.
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
No, there is no pattern or relation between the different locations.
SQL code used for analysis:
SELECT business.name, business.city
, category.category, business.stars
,hours.hours, business.review_count,
business.address, business.postal_code
FROM (business INNER JOIN category ON business.id = category.business_id) 
INNER JOIN hours ON hours.business_id = business.id
WHERE business.city = 'Las Vegas' AND category.category = 'Shopping' AND business.stars != 3.5
GROUP BY business.stars;
		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1: There are more reviews for businesses that are open currently compared to the ones that are closed. 
         
+---------------------+-------------------+---------------+---------+
| COUNT(DISTINCT(id)) | SUM(review_count) |    AVG(stars) | is_open |
+---------------------+-------------------+---------------+---------+
|                1520 |             35261 | 3.52039473684 |       0 |
|                8480 |            269300 | 3.67900943396 |       1 |
+---------------------+-------------------+---------------+---------+         
ii. Difference 2: There are more businesses which are open than the ones that are closed. The Average stars for the businesses open is 3.67 which is slightly higher when compared to the businesses closed which have average stars 3.52.
         
         
+---------------------+-------------------+---------------+---------+
| COUNT(DISTINCT(id)) | SUM(review_count) |    AVG(stars) | is_open |
+---------------------+-------------------+---------------+---------+
|                1520 |             35261 | 3.52039473684 |       0 |
|                8480 |            269300 | 3.67900943396 |       1 |
+---------------------+-------------------+---------------+---------+         
SQL code used for analysis:

		SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(id)), SUM(review_count), AVG(stars), is_open
		FROM business
		GROUP BY is_open
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
I wanted to check if there is a pattern or a relation between the businesses being closed/open and the number of reviews they have and the type of review they have.
         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
I will need the columns is_open,stars,review_count from the business table and useful,funny and cool columns from review. This will be our preliminary analysis where we find out that the stores that are closed have lesser number of reviews although the reviews all are on an average really good(3.5-5). However the number of reviews makes the businesses more popular. This would be a generalised conclusion, but there are many businesses with many reviews but still they might be closed.
                           
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
+---------+-------+--------------+--------+-------+------+
| is_open | stars | review_count | useful | funny | cool |
+---------+-------+--------------+--------+-------+------+

+---------+-------+--------------+--------+-------+------+       
         
iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:
